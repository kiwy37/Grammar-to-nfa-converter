# Grammar-to-nfa-converter

This application constructs a finite automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) for a context-free grammar G = (VN, VT, S, P). Additionally, the application implements various functions, such as VerifyGrammar, IsRegular, PrintGrammar, and ReadGrammar for the grammar, and VerifyAutomaton, PrintAutomaton, CheckWord, and IsDeterministic for the automaton.
This application was developed for the LFC lab (Limbaje Formale si Compilatoare) as first homework.
